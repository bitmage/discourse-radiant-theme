<p>To raise awareness about Stakeholder Capitalism, most areas of Yellow.Forum are available without creating an account. <a href="/signup">Join Yellow.Forum</a> for FREE to access to all areas and participate in the community.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In his recent documentary “Stakeholder Communism,” TV producer and independent investigative filmmaker Richard Jeffs exposes the World Economic Forum’s elite members to be deceptively and undemocratically transitioning us to a single, global, authoritarian political system called Stakeholder Capitalism.</p>

<p>Under the banner of Stakeholder Capitalism the “Stakeholders” are transitioning us towards a future of widespread poverty and extreme tyrannical restrictions on our lives. Their success in Klaus Schwabb’s words at “penetrating cabinets” around the world is quite undeniable, and they seem to be on track to achieve their vision if the people of the world do nothing.</p>

<p>For those that have become aware of this transition, the questions may arise:  What do we do about this?  If we don’t want Stakeholder Capitalism, then what do we want?  How can we solve the pressures and crises of the moment in a way that preserve democracy and a free society?</p>

<p>To move towards answering these questions, Richard has teamed up with tech lead & cofounder Brandon Mason to create Yellow.Forum, a non-profit organization.  We&#39;re launching with an online forum so that people can gather, learn more about what’s happening, and to begin to form a response.  We hope you’ll join us in asserting that the perspectives and needs of the people <em>must</em> be represented in the policies of our governments.</p>

<p>Join us at Yellow.Forum!</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>Yellow.Forum’s mission is to stop The Great Reset transition to Stakeholder Capitalism by creating a space for independent media and a courageous community to collaborate on solution-focussed projects and initiatives. Together, let’s shape The Great Revolution!</p>

<h2>Our Technology</h2>

<p>Our forum is built on the open source Discourse platform.  Where ever possible we have endeavored to use solutions that we can self host if needed, as we want to give ourselves options should any deplatforming attempts occur.  We believe that technologies that foster autonomy and privacy are core to a democratic future for humanity, and we will continue to invest in tools and education to put power in the hands of individuals.</p>
