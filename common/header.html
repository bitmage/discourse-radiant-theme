<h2>Background</h2>

<p>In his recent documentary Stakeholder Communism, TV producer and independent investigative filmmaker, Richard Jeffs, our undemocratic and discrete ten-year transition to an authoritarian political system called Stakeholder Capitalism.</p>

<p>This new system replaces Shareholder Capitalism (used in the West) and State Capitalism (used in the East) with a global political system that is adopted by all G20 countries. This marks a monumental moment in our history; yet, our governments and media are failing to inform us about this transition, presenting several red flags.</p>

<p>To learn who acquires such unprecedented global authority and how Stakeholder Capitalism works, please see our articles and films, which are available for free here at Yellow.Forum.</p>

<p>As well as driving a campaign to stop our transition to Stakeholder Capitalism, we explore some complex issues regarding the future of work in an economy and society dominated by artificial intelligence and automation. We invite you to help us design a blueprint for a more free and prosperous world, which benefits us (rather than a group of powerful Stakeholders).</p>

<p>Richard teamed up with tech lead & co-founder Brandon Mason to build Yellow.Forum, a not-for-profit organisation, which provides the tools we need to achieve our mission.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support.</p>

<h2>Our Technology</h2>

<p>Yellow.Forum is independently run on a combination of open-source and proprietery software. Our intention with the technology stack is to make ourselves censorship resistant, so that we can fall back to other providers or even self hosting if necessary. We believe technologies that foster autonomy and privacy are core to a democratic future; we will continue to invest in tools and education to put the power in the hands of people.</p>
